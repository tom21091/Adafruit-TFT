Adafruit-TFT
============

This is a demonstration of the use of an Adafruit 1.8" 18-bit color TFT LCD display with an Ultrasonic PING sensor on a chipKIT microcontroller board.

-------------

This self-contained MPIDE sketch activates the TFT screen and contains several demos of the operation of the screen. An Ultrasonic PING sensor is used to changed the location of some of the images produced on the TFT.
I pulled some code from the Adafruit GFX library to create a few shapes. I wrote all of the Bitmap decoding and PING sensor functions.
